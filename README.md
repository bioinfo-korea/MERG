# MERG (A meta-analysis of repeat genome-wide association studies)
We show that a meta-analysis of repeat GWASs (MERG) can detect many significant results, which is difficult with a conventional GWAS, even with thousands of samples. Moreover, our MERG showed high reproducibility. Among the results, known type 2 diabetes-associated variants were enriched significantly.
